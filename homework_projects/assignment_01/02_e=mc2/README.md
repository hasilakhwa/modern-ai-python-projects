Mass-Energy Calculator ⚡


Description
A simple Python program that reads mass from the user and calculates the equivalent energy using Einstein’s famous equation:
E = m × c²

How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed.
Open terminal and run:
python mass_energy_calculator.py


Requirements
Python 3
Uses built-in functions only (no extra libraries needed).

Example Output
Enter kilos of mass: 100
e = m * C^2...
m = 100.0 kg
C = 299792458 m/s
8.987551787368176e+18 joules of energy!
