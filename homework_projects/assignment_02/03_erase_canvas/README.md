# Canvas Eraser Game

## Problem Statement
Create an interactive canvas where a pink "eraser" can be moved around to erase blue cells by turning them white.

## How it Works
- The canvas is a 400x400 grid filled with blue rectangles.
- After clicking anywhere, a pink eraser appears.
- Moving the mouse drags the eraser across the canvas.
- Any blue cell the eraser touches changes to white.

## Features
- Interactive mouse control.
- Real-time erasing effect.
- Smooth movement with small delay for better experience.

## How to Run
1. Install the `graphics.py` module if not already available.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

Requirements
Python 3.6+

graphics.py library (for creating the canvas)

Example
Click to spawn the eraser, then drag to erase cells!
