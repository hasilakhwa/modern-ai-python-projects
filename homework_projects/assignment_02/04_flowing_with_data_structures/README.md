# Add Three Copies Program

## Problem Statement
This program demonstrates the concept of *mutability* in Python.  
Mutable data types like lists can be changed inside a function without needing to return them.

The program:
- Takes a message from the user.
- Initializes an empty list.
- Adds three copies of the message into the list using a helper function.
- Shows the list before and after modification.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6+ recommended).
2. Save the code in a file named `main.py`.
3. Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
python main.py
