# Continuous Input to List Program

## Problem Statement
This program continuously prompts the user to enter values, which are added one by one to a list. The program stops collecting inputs when the user presses Enter without typing anything. After that, it prints the list.

### Example Run:

**User Input:**
Enter a value: 1 Enter a value: 2 Enter a value: 3 Enter a value:         

**Output:**
Here's the list: ['1', '2', '3']


## How to Run
1. Run the Python file.
2. Enter values one by one when prompted.
3. Press Enter without typing anything to finish.
4. The list will be printed.

### Code Explanation:
- An empty list `lst` is created to store the values entered by the user.
- The program keeps asking for values until the user presses Enter without typing anything.
- Once the input process stops, the program prints the list containing all the entered values.

## Notes
- The program handles continuous input, and the list will only be printed after the user stops entering values.

How to Use:
Copy the Python code to a file (e.g., list_input_program.py).

Run the file using Python.

Follow the prompts to input values.
