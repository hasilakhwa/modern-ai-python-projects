# Add Many Numbers

## Problem Statement

## How it Works
- The `add_many_numbers` function iterates over a list of integers.
- It accumulates the sum of all elements.
- The `main` function provides an example usage of this function.

## Example
```bash
Input List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: The sum of the numbers is: 15

How to Run
